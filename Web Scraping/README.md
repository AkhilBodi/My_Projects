Hey There, This is Akhil Bodi. This is my another project called Web Scraping which is a way of obtaining large amounts of data. As a part of my Data Science Journey, I made this data related project in-order to gain knowlege and expertise in handling data. This project taught me the functions of BeautifulSoup, Requests module(python) and more importantly how to scrape the data from a website. Huge thanks to MR.CoreyMSchafer(https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer) for their amazing tutorial. Please do share your feedback and do let me know if there are any mistakes or if the code can be much more efficient and better. Thank you so much for your time :)
