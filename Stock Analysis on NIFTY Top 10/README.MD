Hey There, This is Akhil Bodi. This is my First Data Analysis project on NIFTY(Indian stock market index) Top 10 Stock market data in which I analysed the stock data from 2000 to 2021. On my First Data Analysis project I wanted to create something simple yet challenging also something that helps me to recall my learnings. This project taught me the importance of descriptive statistics, when to drop data, how to add different columns from the available column, plots especially the pie plot, labelling and analyzing the data. Will for sure work on this data with better ideas in future as lot more can be done. As earlier and always, please do share your feedback and do let me know if there are any mistakes or if the code can be much more efficient and better. Thank you so much for your time :)
