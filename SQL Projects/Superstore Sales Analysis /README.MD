# Superstore Sales Analysis

Hey There. Another SQL project, this time on sales data. Took up this project as the first step to learn analyzing the data using SQL. Chose this particular project as I this is one of my favorite domains. This project taught me the power of aggregations and their impact. Coming to the learning part, learned how to analyze the data in simple manner and yes this is another way of learning and recalling. As earlier and always, please do share your feedback and do let me know if there are any mistakes or if the code can be much more efficient and better. Thank you so much for your time :)
