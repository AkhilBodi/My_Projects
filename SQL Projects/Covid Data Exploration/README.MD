# Covid Data Exploration 

Hey There. This is a SQL project On COVID data. As a data entusiast, i need to excel  the art of data exploration. Chose this particular project to learn how to explore the data(as the dataset is huge), understand the relations in-between and to learn how to get insights from the data in SQL. This project helped me to understand the process of exploration. Recalled almost every statement learned, to be specific learned the use of JOIN, CAST, Aggregate Functions, CTE(common table expression) and VIEW. Yes the idea of the project might be old but not what it taught. Did the complete project from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f) tutorial. Also huge thanks to the entire MySQL community for helping me out almost all the time.
