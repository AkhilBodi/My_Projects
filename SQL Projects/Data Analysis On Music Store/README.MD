# Analysis On Music Store

Hey There. This project is analysis on music store data. The dataset has data of different customers from different countries including the customers playlist. The dataset also has artists and their albums data. Chose this particular data to practice all I have learned until now. Though most of the queries are basic, learned how to make them more simple. Also the use of ROW_NUMBER function in this project made the concept more clear and JOINS beacame more dear. Now I have a little more grip on SQL. Did the complete project from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFIuIjswMKM&list=WL&index=1) tutorial. As earlier and always, please do share your feedback and do let me know if there are any mistakes or if the code can be much more efficient and better. Thank you so much for your time :)
