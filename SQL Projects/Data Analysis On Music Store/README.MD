# Data Analysis On Music Store

Hey There. This project is analysis on music store data. The dataset has data of differernt customers from different countries including the customers playlist. The dataset also has artists and their albums data. Chose this particular data to practice all I have learned until now. Though most of the queries are basic, learned how to make them more simple. Also the use of ROW_NUMBER function in this project made the concept more clear and JOINS beacame more dear. Now I have a little more grip on SQL. Did the complete project from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFIuIjswMKM&list=WL&index=1) tutorial.
