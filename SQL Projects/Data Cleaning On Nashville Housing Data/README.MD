# Data Cleaning On Nashville Housing Data

Hey There. This is my first project on data cleaning in SQL. As a beginner to this sql world, I learned exploration but not cleaning. So, chose this particular project to learn how to clean the data, understand how & what to update in data. This project helped me in not just understanding cleaning of data but taught what data to choose and what to drop. Also learned how to format data as per our needs and wants. Though it is small but not what it taught. Gave me more boost to learn and work more. Did the complete project from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rO7ztF4NtU&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=3) tutorial.
