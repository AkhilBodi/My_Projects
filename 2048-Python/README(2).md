Hey There, This is Akhil Bodi. This is my second project called 2048 where we add the alike numbers together and they get doubled. This game is quite popular and fun, as it asks us to pay absolute attention. Also reason behind this particular game is that this game is one of my most played games and since i was a child i wanted to build this. This project taught me use of loops and I never thought that loops are THIS EFFECTIVE and I realised that reading the code is easy or looking by the code we feel that it's simple but believe me it is not and i'm glad to be proven wrong. Also credits to (https://github.com/plemaster01) for their tutorial for this particular project. Please do share your feedback and do let me know if there are any mistakes or if the code can be much more efficient and better. Thank you so much for your time :)
