Hey There, This is Akhil Bodi. This is my first project called Tic-Tac-Toe which is quite famous game especially among new/beginner coding folks.
I wanted to create something simple and easy with my learnings and this idea of builing a project hit my mind first specifically Tic-Tac-Toe as it's easy,simple and fun.
Also games are what we would go after when we get bored right?.
This project taught me the proper use of python functions, how to name the variables and the importance of clean readable code.
Also as i said in the beginning this is my first project, so please do share your feedback and do let me know if there are any mistakes or if the code can be much more efficient and better.
Thank you so much for your time :)
